        <p>Time management is an important concept in Islam, and the Quran and Hadith provide guidance 
            on how Muslims should manage their time effectively. 
            Let's take a look at some examples of time management in the light of the Quran and Hadith.

            <p>1.      Prioritizing Religious Obligations: In Islam, the five daily prayers (Salah) are a mandatory 
            obligation that Muslims must perform on time. The Quran says, "Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers 
            a decree of specified times." (4:103) This verse highlights the importance of prioritizing Salah in one's daily routine. 
            Muslims should schedule their other activities around the five daily prayers and make sure that they perform them on time.
            
            2.      Avoiding Procrastination: Procrastination is discouraged in Islam, and the Prophet Muhammad 
            (peace be upon him) said, "Make the most of five things before five others: 
            your youth before your old age, your health before your sickness, your wealth before your poverty, 
            your free time before your work, and your life before your death.
            " This Hadith emphasizes the importance of utilizing one's time effectively and avoiding procrastination. 
            Muslims should take advantage of their free time to engage in productive activities and avoid putting off important tasks.</p>
            
            <p>3.      Time as a Precious Resource: The Quran also emphasizes the importance of time as a precious resource 
            that should not be wasted. Allah says, "And [by] the time, indeed, mankind is in loss, except for those who have believed 
            and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.
            " (103:1-3) This verse highlights the fleeting nature of time and the importance of utilizing it for righteous deeds. 
            Muslims should make the most of their time by engaging in acts of worship, seeking knowledge, and doing good deeds.</p>
            
            <p>4.      Balancing Work and Family: Islam encourages Muslims to maintain a healthy balance between their work and family life. 
            The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "The best of you are those who are best to their families, and I am the best among you to my family.
            " This Hadith emphasizes the importance of spending quality time with family and fulfilling one's familial obligations. 
            Muslims should schedule their work and other activities around their family commitments and make sure that they devote enough time to their loved ones.</p>
            
            <p>In conclusion, time management is an essential aspect of Islam, and the Quran and Hadith provide 
            guidance on how Muslims should manage their time effectively. 
            By prioritizing religious obligations, avoiding procrastination, recognizing time as a precious resource, 
            and balancing work and family life, Muslims can make the most of their time and achieve success in this life and in the hereafter.
